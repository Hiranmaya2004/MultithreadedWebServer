# Multithreaded Web Server

A Java-based multithreaded web server implementation designed to handle multiple client requests concurrently, improving server responsiveness and throughput.

## About

This project implements a basic web server using Java threads to enable handling multiple HTTP client connections simultaneously. It demonstrates core networking concepts, socket programming, and concurrent request processing.

## Features

- Multithreaded request handling for simultaneous clients
- Basic HTTP/1.1 protocol support
- Serving static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Graceful handling of client connections and disconnections
- Simple logging of incoming requests and responses

## Technologies Used

- Java Socket programming
- Multithreading with Java Threads
- Standard Java I/O for file handling
- HTTP protocol basics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Hiranmaya2004/MultithreadedWebServer.git
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile:
3. Run the server:
4. Access the server via a web browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or configured port).

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Java source files for server implementation
- `bin/` - Compiled bytecode (generated after compile)
- `resources/` - Static files served by the server (if any)

## Usage

The server listens on a specified port and creates a new thread for each incoming client connection. Requests are parsed, and appropriate responses are served back to the client. Useful for learning the fundamentals of web servers and concurrency.
